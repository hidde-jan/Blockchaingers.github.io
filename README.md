# Code quality matters during Blockchaingers Hackathon!

When: 5 - 8 April 2018

Where:  The former Sugar Factory, Groningen NL

Website: [Blockchaingers.org](https://blockchaingers.org)



## How your code is evaluated

1. Your code will be evaluated against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) (Ask for a free copy at the event)

2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png).

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub CI and can run at Pull Requests and Pushes.

4. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum codebase size 200 KLoc.
